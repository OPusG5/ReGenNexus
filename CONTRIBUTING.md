## Contribution Process

1. **Find or Create an Issue**
   - Check existing issues for something you'd like to work on
   - Create a new issue describing your proposed contribution
   - Discuss the approach with maintainers before starting work

2. **Fork and Clone**
   - Fork the repository
   - Clone your fork locally
   - Set up the development environment

3. **Create a Branch**
   - Create a branch for your changes
   - Use a descriptive name related to the issue

4. **Make Changes**
   - Focus on the core protocol functionality
   - Follow the coding standards
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

5. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Push your changes to your fork
   - Create a pull request to the main repository
   - Reference the related issue
   - Provide a clear description of your changes

## Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Write clear, descriptive comments
- Include docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Use type hints where appropriate

## Testing Requirements

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request
- Aim for high test coverage
- Include integration tests for complex features

## Documentation

- Update documentation for any changed functionality
- Document new features thoroughly
- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples where appropriate
- Keep the README and getting started guides up to date

## Scope Guidelines

The open-source core protocol focuses on the fundamental communication framework. When contributing, please respect these boundaries:

### In Scope for Core Protocol

- Message protocol implementation
- Entity registry system
- Context management
- Basic security features
- Protocol versioning
- Documentation and examples
- Testing and validation
- Performance optimizations
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Out of Scope for Core Protocol

- LLM integration (premium feature)
- Connection Manager (premium feature)
- Device Detection Framework (premium feature)
- Advanced adapter generation
- Application-specific implementations
- Automated code generation features
- Hardware-specific optimizations

## Community Roadmap

We maintain a public roadmap for the core protocol in the ROADMAP.md file. Before proposing major changes, please review this roadmap to understand:

1. What features are planned for the core protocol
2. What features are reserved for premium extensions
3. The current priorities for development

This helps ensure your contributions align with the project's direction and avoids duplicated effort.

## Getting Help

- Join our community discussions on GitHub Discussions
- Ask questions in the appropriate channels
- Check the documentation for guidance
- Reach out to maintainers if you're unsure about scope

Thank you for contributing to ReGenNexus UAP Core!
